# Anonymous Proxy

Anonymous Proxy  is a project developed for Adalab. To produce this website I used a starter kit, created in **node and gulp**. 

## Website

It has been adapted to 3 levels of responsiveness:mobile, tablet and desktop. This website consists of 5 main areas: 

- Header: In this case is a menu button that takes you to the Adalab website.
- Main: It contains 3 subareas:
   -- Hero: It ocupyes the full width and height of the screen.
   -- Section1:
   -- Section 2: I applied display:grid for the three levels of responsiveness.
- Footer: This footer has 2 sets of links that take you to the Adalab website and an area with copyright information.
